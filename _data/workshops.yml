    \ workshop assistants will learn how to process streams of data in\r\nreal time\
    \ by using spark and python. A series of coding exercises will\r\nguide audience\
    \ across most relevant Spark DStreams features. Assistants\r\nwill also learn\
    \ how to integrate spark streams with other spark extensions.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\
    \n\r\nConsume data streams in real time from TCP Servers.\r\n\r\nApply data processing\
    \ techniques such as map reduce to live streams of data.\r\n\r\nIntegrate data\
    \ stream processing with other Spark extensions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n\
    Processing big data on real time is a challenging endeavor for different\r\nreasons\
    \ such as scalability difficulties, consistency of the information,\r\ntolerance\
    \ to faults, among others.\r\n\r\nApache Spark provides a collection of APIs that\
    \ can be used to perform\r\ngeneral-purpose computation in clustered environments.\r\
    \n\r\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring an introduction to processing of \r\
    \ndata in real time by using spark.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop contains 3 sections,\
    \ each one of 30 minutes. The\r\nremaining time will be used to answer questions\
    \ and help assistants with\r\nthe practical exercises.\r\n\r\nThe first section\
    \ of the workshop provides an introduction to most\r\nrelevant features of Spark,\
    \ including Resilient Distributed Datasets\r\n(RDDs), SQL and Dataframes.\r\n\r\
    \nThe second section covers how to use Spark\r\nStreaming API to consume data\
    \ streams on real time from TCP sockets.\r\n\r\nThe third section shows how to\
    \ integrate Spark Streaming with the machine\r\nlearning Spark extension.\r\n\r\
    \n\r\nAudience\r\n\r\nThis workshop is aimed to software engineers, architects\
    \ and IT professionals\r\nin general with interest in distributed systems and\
    \ big data analytics.\r\nNo previous knowledge or experience with spark is required\
    \ but it will be\r\nhelpful. Basic python knowledge is expected.\r\n\r\nBiography\r\
    \n\r\nManuel Ignacio Franco Galeano, computer scientist from Colombia.\r\nHe works\
    \ for Fender musical instruments as lead engineer in Dublin, Ireland.\r\nHe holds\
    \ a MSC in computer science from University College Dublin UCD.\r\nHis areas of\
    \ interest and research are music information retrieval,\r\ndata analytics, distributed\
    \ systems, blockchain technologies among others."

    \n3) Run a Kubernetes cluster on their notebook\r\n4) Deploy and manage services\
    \ on the cluster\r\n5) Write declarative recipes for reproducing the setup universally"

- description: "Test-Driven Development is a methodology that can greatly improve\
    \ the quality of your software. I strongly believe that developing software without\
    \ following as much as possible a test-driven approach leads to massive delays\
    \ and greater issues when requirements change (always, that is). In this workshop\
    \ we will develop a very simple Python project following TDD with the help of\
    \ the pytest framework. We will work together, and no previous knowledge of testing\
    \ or the testing framework is required. A minimum knowledge of Python is required,\
    \ but the project will be very simple, so that we can focus on learning the testing\
    \ methodology.\r\n\r\nPresented at London PyGirls Meetup and PyCon UK 2018.\r\n\
    \r\nThe workshop lasts 3-4 hours, it cannot be squeezed in 2 hours. If there is\
    \ no longer slot available I have to withdraw the proposal"

    \ for the first time - sometimes encounter some \u2018strange\u2019 issues, but\
    \ understanding Python\u2019s OOP implementation will help make many of them seem\
    \ a lot less strange.\r\nThis workshop will introduce beginners to Python\u2019\
    s beautiful but sometimes peculiar implementation of OOP concepts. It\u2019s ideal\
    \ for people who have a bit of Python knowledge and experience, and need to move\
    \ from first steps to a deeper understanding.\r\n\r\nThe workshop has been presented\
    \ at many Python conferences, including PyCon Ireland in past years and has always\
    \ been full packed of attendees. This year I completely reworked the slides to\
    \ better explain some of the points where attendees struggled in the past."

    \ topics, and possibly regression analysis to assess the impact of the information\
    \ financial markets. It will include mentions to packages like gensim, Scikit\
